Text Encryption:
With the rapid growing of internet and networks applications, data security becomes
more important than ever before. Encryption algorithms play an important role in
information security systems. In this, we have a study of the popular encryption
algorithm: Blowfish and Cipher block chaining using AES. We overviewed the base
functions and analyzed the security for algorithms. The main concern is about the
performance of algorithms under different settings, the presented comparison takes
into consideration the behavior and the performance of the algorithm when different
data loads are used. Here the comparison is made on these parameters: speed, block
size, and key siz

Image Encription:
Vulnerability of communication of digital images is an extremely important issue
nowadays, particularly when the images are communicated through insecure channels.
To improve communication security, many cryptosystems have been presented in the
image encryption literature. This project proposes a novel image encryption technique
based on the algorithms DES, AES and RSA which is faster than current methods. The
proposed algorithm eliminates the step in which the secrete key is shared during the
encryption process. It is formulated based on the symmetric encryption (using DES and
AES) and asymmetric encryption (using RSA). The image is encrypted using DES and AES,
then, the secret key is encrypted by means of RSA and itis hidden in the ciphered image.
The analysis results show that while enjoying the faster computation, our method
performs close to optimal in terms of accuracy
